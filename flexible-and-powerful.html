    <p>The CallPower tool has placed hundreds of thousands to calls to Congress, the White House, the FCC, and other decision-makers. Now you can use this power to win campaigns at any scale.</p>

    <p>We can automatically connect callers to their Senators, Representatives, Governor, and state legislators. With custom data imports you can enter local government or corporate contact numbers and send phone calls to targets that may not be used to a receiving public feedback.</p>

    <p>Phone calls are powerful modes of civic engagement, and Call Power makes it easy for your members.</p>
