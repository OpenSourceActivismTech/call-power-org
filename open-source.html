        <p>We believe that our technology should reflect our values. We built CallPower with the help of many layers of open source code, and the support of organizations that believe in code freedom, innovation, and sharing.</p>

        <p>Our code is licensed freely under the <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">AGPL</a>, which is a "copyleft" license. This means that if anyone makes changes to the software for their own uses, these changes must be available under the same license. This ensures that the movement will always own the best copy of the software.</p>

        <p>For organizations that do not wish to run the code themselves, we will provide hosting and support for a nominal fee. Usage fees may be charged by the telephony provider Twilio (currently 1.5&cent; / min in the US). 501c3 organizations may apply for a discount and $500 in credit through <a href="http://www.twilio.org">Twilio.org</a>.<p>
