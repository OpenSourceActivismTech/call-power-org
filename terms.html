		<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;, &quot;Terms and Conditions&quot;) carefully before using the https://callpower.org website (the &quot;Service&quot;) operated by Josh Levinger d/b/a Spacedog XYZ (&quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;).</p>
		<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
		<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>
		<p><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
		<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
		<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Spacedog XYZ cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal by contacting Spacedog XYZ customer support team.</p>
		<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Spacedog XYZ with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Spacedog XYZ to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
		<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, or if we have agreed to a post-payment plan, Spacedog XYZ will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
		<p><strong>Fee Changes</strong></p>
		<p>Spacedog XYZ, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
		<p>Spacedog XYZ will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
		<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
		<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
		<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Spacedog XYZ on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Spacedog XYZ.</p>
		<p><strong>Accounts</strong></p>
		<p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.</p>
		<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

		<p><strong>Limitation Of Liability</strong></p>
		<p>In no event shall Spacedog XYZ, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

		<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
		<p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
